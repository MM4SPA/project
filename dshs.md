The <a href="https://www.dshs-koeln.de/en/institut-fuer-trainingswissenschaft-und-sportinformatik/" style="color:black"><i> Institute for Exercise Training and Sports Informatics </i></a> lead by Prof. Dr. Daniel Memmert is working in different areas. In the field of sports informatics and sports game research, issues related to Big Data in sports (especially professional soccer) are addressed, especially in the area of modeling, pattern recognition and simulation of team games. This includes developments in data analysis and data visualization as well as the application of modern database systems (Relational and NoSQL). 

The expertise lies at the interface between exercise science, sports informatics and sports psychology. Cooperation partners come from business and competitive sports, among others.

Different technical equipment (e.g. position data analysis with SOCCER©, tracking data with Kinexon©, SoccerBot360, mobile eye-tracker) allows to investigate relevant sport informatics, exercise science, and sport psychology questions in the individual sport games - especially experimentally. Of special research interest are novel game analysis possibilities in competitive sports (position data, virtual reality, augmented reality), the handling of Big Data (e.g. pattern recognition, classification), motivation and attention research, the promotion of creativity and performance in the junior performance area (cross-sport game ball school, snow school, adventure movement) as well as sport-specific sport psychological diagnostics and intervention (memory, attention, perception).

Overall, the projects not only aim to expand basic theoretical knowledge in the aforementioned research areas (DFG), but can also be characterized as application-oriented (DFL; BISp) and thus service-compatible.
