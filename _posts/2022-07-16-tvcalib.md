Sports field registration in broadcast videos is typically interpreted as the task of homography estimation, which provides a mapping between a planar field and the corresponding visible area of the image. 
In contrast, camera calibration can provide a mapping between the real-world and a related image.

With our work <a href="{{page.project-url}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TVCalib</a>, we participated in the <a href="https://github.com/SoccerNet/sn-calibration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SoccerNet-Calibration challange</a> hosted at the <a href="https://vap.aau.dk/cvsports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVSports Workshop</a> at CVPR'22 and further adressed this task in a <a href="{{page.paper-url}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research paper</a> which is accepted for publication at the *IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision* (WACV'23).

More details can be found on the corresponding <a href="{{page.project-url}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project website</a> including a <a href="{{page.paper-url}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">preprint</a> and <a href="{{page.code-url}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source code</a>.
