A new <a href="{{page.paper-url}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> emerging from the MM4SPA project has just been published in *Applied Intelligence*!

In this study, the authors compared several common data representation formats that have recently been used to process football tracking data with deep learning architectures. Based on their benefits and drawbacks, a new graph-based representation and a corresponding hybrid network were proposed. 

In a comprehensive state-of-the-art comparison on the same generic classification task, it was found that this new representation achieves top results while being 100 times leaner than networks of similar capabilities. The resulting *TGNet* is a light-weight, hybrid graph-based network that may be used for all deep learning applications involving tracking data and is now being deployed in several follow-up studies.
